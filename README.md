# Air Quality Analysis

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes and forecasts air pollution levels using the UCI Air Quality dataset. We integrate statistical time series models and machine learning techniques to improve air quality predictions. The approach includes SARIMAX for time series forecasting, SAPRC BioChem simulations for chemical modeling, and neural networks for pollutant concentration predictions.  

## Dataset  
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Air Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality)  
- **Time Period:** March 2004 – February 2005 (Hourly Data)  
- **Variables:** 15 features including NO₂, CO, C6H6, NOx, temperature, humidity  

## Methods  
- **SARIMAX + SAPRC Hybrid Model:** Time series forecasting with chemical reaction modeling  
- **Neural Networks:** Multi-layer perceptrons for pollutant concentration prediction
## Goals
