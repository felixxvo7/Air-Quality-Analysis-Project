## Introduction:

The **UCI Air Quality dataset** provides a comprehensive record of pollution levels in Rome, Italy, capturing hourly measurements of key pollutants—including Carbon Monoxide ($CO$), Nitrogen Dioxide ($NO_2$), Total Nitrogen Oxides ($NO_x$), Benzene ($C_6H_6$), and Non-Methane Hydrocarbons ($NMHC$)—alongside sensor responses and environmental variables such as temperature and humidity. This dataset offers a unique opportunity to analyze sensor performance, assess air quality trends, and develop predictive models for pollutant concentrations. The primary objectives of this analysis include **sensor calibration and air quality assessment**, where we evaluate the correlation between sensor readings and true pollutant concentrations, detect cross-sensitivities, and analyze seasonal variations in the Air Quality Index (AQI). Additionally, the study focuses on **regression-based CO prediction**, **time series and hybrid modeling**, and **machine learning comparison** to enhance pollutant forecasting and air quality monitoring.


## 1. Data Characteristics and Correlation Analysis

### 1.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Distribution & Outlier Analysis

![](Plots/pollutants_dist_outlier.png)

**Figure 1**: The Histograms reveal right-skewed distributions for all pollutants. This non-normality motivates the use of **non-parametric correlation measures**. Additionally, boxplots highlight the presence of significant outliers across all pollutants. The consistent pattern of **median concentrations being lower than the means** confirms the positive skewness of the data.

### 1.2 Correlation Matrix Interpretation

### Methodology

Given the non-normal distributions and the presence of extreme values, we utilize Spearman's rank correlation ($\rho$), a non-parametric measure that captures monotonic relationships without assuming linearity.

### Sensor-Pollutant Relationships:

![](./Plots/pollutant_vs_sensor_environment.png)

**Figure 2**: The Correlation Heatmap reveals: The relationships between pollutants and sensors show a strong positive correlation for `CO` and `Sensor CO` ($\rho$ = 0.85) and a strong negative correlation for $NO_x$ and `Sensor NOx` ($\rho$ = -0.77), while `NO2` and `Sensor NO2` have a weak correlation ($\rho$ = 0.21). Pollutants exhibit weak or no correlation with environmental factors ($\rho$ $\in$ (-0.35, 0.28)). However, cross-sensitivity detection suggests potential sensor interference, as `CO` correlates highly with `Sensor NOx, NMHC, and O3`, $NO_x$ and `NO2` show moderate correlation with `Sensor CO, NMHC, and O3`, and $C_6H_6$ has high correlation with `Sensor NMHC` and moderate correlation with other sensors.

### 1.3 Robust Correlation Validation

### Methodology

To verify sensor-reference pollutant correlations beyond traditional correlation metrics, we conducted permutation tests (n = 1000 iterations). This non-parametric approach: First we compute the observed Spearman's $\rho$, then generating a null distribution by shuffling reference values, using those to calculate empirical p-values

### Result

The permutation test for $CO$, $NO_2$ and $NO_x$ against their respective sensors yielded empirical **p-value \< 0.001**, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that there are strong and statistically significant correlation between sensor and corresponding concentration. As a **non-parametric test**, this validation method strengthens the confidence in our findings **without relying on normality assumptions**.

## 2. Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis

### 2.1 Understanding AQI

### What is AQI?

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized metric used to communicate the health risks of air pollution. It translates complex pollutant concentration data into a single, easy-to-understand value on a 0 - 500 scale, with higer values indicating worse air quality.

### Custom AQI Methodology

In this study, we employ a **Custom AQI** methodology where $CO$ and $NO_2$ follow standard **EPA AQI** breakpoints, benzene ($C_6H_6$) is assessed using **WHO exposure limits**, and $NO_x$ is evaluated using the same breakpoints ranges as $NO_2$. This approach ensures alignment with established regulatory standards while incorporating WHO-recommended guidelines for benzene exposure.

### 2.2 AQI Calculation Methodology

The AQI is computed as:

$$
AQI = \max\left(\frac{I_{HI}-I_{LO}}{BP_{HI}-BP_{LO}}(C-BP_{LO}) + I_{LO}\right) \text{ across all pollutants}
$$

where:

-   $I_{HI/LO}$ = AQI category thresholds
-   $BP_{HI/LO}$ = Breakpoints concentrations
-   $C$ = Observed pollutant concentration

**Breakpoints reference table:**

| Category | $AQI Range$ | $CO$ | $NO_2$ | $NO_x$ | $C_6H_6$ |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Good** | 0-50 | 0-4.4 | 0-53 | 0-53 | 0-3 |
| **Moderate** | 51-100 | 4.4-9.4 | 53-100 | 53-100 | 3-7 |
| **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | 101-150 | 9.4-12.4 | 100-360 | 100-360 | 7-10 |
| **Unhealthy** | 151-200 | 12.4-15.4 | 360-649 | 360-649 | 10-15 |
| **Very Unhealthy** | 201-300 | 15.4-30.4 | 649-1249 | 649-1249 | 15-20 |
| **Hazardous** | 301-500 | 30.4-50.4 | 1249-2049 | 1249-2049 | 20-30 |

### 2.3 Temporal AQI Patterns

![](./Plots/AQI_trend.png)

**Figure 3**: The AQI trend shows significant fluctuations, frequently exceeding the `Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups` and `Unhealthy` thresholds, with occasional peaks reaching `Very Unhealthy` levels. The highest peaks, reaching `Hazardous` range, are observed during late 2004. A sharp rise in AQI during Winter suggests increased pollution, likely due to heightened combustion activities, while Summer peaks align with high benzene ($C_6H_6$) contributions. Early 2005 shows a slight decline in AQI, though persistent fluctuations suggest evolving emission patterns and seasonal influences on air quality.

### 2.4 Pollutant-Specific Contributions

![](./Plots/AQI_trend_colored.png)

| Season       | Primary Pollutant | Contribution |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------:|
| Spring(2004) | $C_6H_6$          |     `87.95`% |
| Summer       | $C_6H_6$          |     `90.22`% |
| Fall         | $C_6H_6$          |     `76.92`% |
| Winter       | $NO_x$            |     `67.78`% |
| Spring(2005) | $NO_x$            |     `54.29`% |

**Figure 4**: Table 2 summarizes the seasonal contributions of individual pollutans to AQI, revealing that benzene ($C_6H_6$) is the dominant pollutant in Spring, Summer and Fall, accounting for over 75% of AQI excrescences, with a peak contributes of 90.22% during Summer. In contrast, Winter AQI is primarily influenced by $NO_x$ , which contributes 67.78%, likely due to increased combustion activities. The transition period in early Spring 2005 marks a shift, where $NO_x$ and $C_6H_6$ exhibit nearly equal contributions, indicating a changing pollution patterns over time.

## 4. Seasonal Variation Analysis

![](./Plots/AQI_category_seasonal.png)

**Figure 5**: The AQI category distribution varies by season, showing a shift from moderate air quality in Spring (Mar–May 2004) to worsening conditions in Summer (Jun–Aug 2004) and Fall (Sep–Nov 2004), where "Unhealthy" and "Very Unhealthy" categories dominate, with a small proportion reaching "Hazardous" levels. Winter (Dec–Feb 2004) continues to have high pollution, with a majority in the "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" and "Unhealthy" categories, while early Spring (Mar–Apr 2005) shows slight improvement with a higher proportion of moderate air quality. This seasonal pattern suggests increased pollution in Fall and Winter, likely due to combustion-related emissions, while air quality improves slightly in transitional periods.
