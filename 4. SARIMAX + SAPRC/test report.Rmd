## Formating
The air quality data was initially cleaned by removing empty rows and columns, and by converting character columns—where commas were used as decimal points—into proper numeric format. The Date column was also converted from string format to a proper date type.

To handle missing data, we first identified gaps using the is.na() and summary() functions. Since -200 was used as a placeholder for missing values, it was temporarily replaced with 0 to allow for five-number summary analysis and help determine which variables were most affected. During this process, we observed that the median value of NMHC_GT is 0, indicating that this variable may contain a large number of zero values, which could impact interpretation and imputation strategies.

After examining the data's summary statistics and missingness patterns, we found that some variables exhibit Missing Not At Random (MNAR) behavior, while others are Missing At Random (MAR). Imputation was then applied based on variable type: for time-series columns such as T, RH, and AH, we used multiple imputation methods including forward fill, backward fill, and interpolation. For correlated sensor variables, we applied KNN imputation, as these features included both continuous and categorical data. The improvements from cleaning and imputing were evident upon reviewing the updated five-number summaries.
